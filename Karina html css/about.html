	<h3>About Me</h3> <br><br>
	<p>Self-taught web developer with a experience in JavaScripts , HTML, CSS, Bootsraps, Jquery, Jquery UI and some exposure to Angular, React, Redux, ngrx and other frameworks. With my pre-existing leadership and communication skills, I am on my way to becoming an excellent developer.
	</p>
	<p>My formal education was in Industrial Engineering, a technical line whcich deal with design, development, implementation, operation, maintenance, and control of all processes in the manufacture of a product.</p>

	<p>One thing my education had contributed to though, was an inclination to be constantly learning, growing, and seeking new challenges. I'd always been fascinated by technology and had dabbled in coding over the years. But it wasn't until shortly after graduating from college that I made the decision to dedicate myself to studying web development and turn an interest in programming from a curiosity into a career.</p>

	<p>Currently, I freelance Web Developer and looking for a full time job. Meanwhile, I continue my personal study on a daily basis; expanding my knowledge of programming, front-end development, database management and more!</p>

	<p>It has always been important to me to continuously evolve as a person and grow my skillset, and the world of programming offers endless opportunities to do just that. I find myself excited every day to continue my growth and explore all that this industry has to offer!</p>
